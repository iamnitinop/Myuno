# Deployment Environment Variables

## Backend (Railway)
Copy these to Railway dashboard:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL=(will be auto-generated by Railway PostgreSQL)
FRONTEND_URL=(will be your Vercel URL, e.g., https://myuno.vercel.app)
CORS_ORIGIN=(same as FRONTEND_URL)
```

## Frontend (Vercel)
Copy these to Vercel dashboard:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=(will be your Railway URL, e.g., https://myuno-backend.railway.app)
```

## Notes:
- Railway will auto-generate DATABASE_URL when you add PostgreSQL
- Update FRONTEND_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL after initial deployment
- You may need to redeploy after updating these variables
